# Gina's Lunch Website

This project will be implemented as a simple HTML/CSS & JS home page for the company Oy Gina's Lunch Ab. It will consist of a single main page divided into sections plus a gallery page for a separate photo gallery. The gallery page is separated so that it only needs to be loaded on demand.

This project was adapted using course project **Tea Station**  from John Smilga's Udemy Course [HTML&CSS Tutorial and Projects Course 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/in-depth-html-css-course-build-responsive-websites/).

The page styling will use a mobile-first approach with media screen sections adapting for bigger screens. It is implemented using old-style floats.

The main page will contain a *header section* containing some animated elements and a *footer section* with some social media links, a *services section* describing company services, a *contact section* with contact info and a contact form. An *about section* with an embedded map and some general company info. The main page will have a mobile friendly *menu* containing links to these sections as well as a link to the separate *gallery page*.
